You are, however, not permitted to discuss the assignments with anyone outside of the class.

### Using AI
- Using AI to understand concepts, exceptions, or compilation errors is permitted
- Using AI as a "search engine" is allowed
- Using any sort of AI-integration in IDEs is not permitted (Copilot, Cursor, etc)
- Turning in AI-generated code is not permitted

### Late policy
Homework assignments are due 11:59 PM on the day of the deadline. Reading reflections are due before class. Any missed quiz or mid-term can be made up within two weeks if documentation is provided. Final exams can be made up at the discretion of the instructor.
